# DEPRECATED: Kubediff

Kubediff is a tool for Kubernetes to show you the differences between your
running configuration and your version controlled configuration.

Kubediff can be run from the command line:

    $ ./kubediff
    usage: kubediff [-h] [--kubeconfig KUBECONFIG] [--context CONTEXT] [--namespace NAMESPACE] [--json] [--no-error-on-diff] [paths ...]

         _          _             _  _   __   __
        | |__ _  _ | |__  ___  __| |(_) / _| / _|
        | / /| || || '_ \/ -_)/ _` || ||  _||  _|
        |_\_\ \_,_||_.__/\___|\__,_||_||_|  |_|

        Compare yaml files in path(s) to running state in kubernetes and print the
        differences. This is useful to ensure you have applied all your changes
        to the appropriate environment. This tools runs kubectl, so unless your
        ~/.kube/config is configured for the correct environment, you will need
        to supply the kubeconfig for the appropriate environment.

    positional arguments:
      paths                  path(s) from which kubediff will look for configuration files

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --kubeconfig KUBECONFIG, -k KUBECONFIG
                            path to kubeconfig
      --context CONTEXT, -c CONTEXT
                            name of kubeconfig context to use
      --namespace NAMESPACE, -n NAMESPACE
                            Namespace to assume for objects where it is not specified (default = Kubernetes default for current context)
      --json, -j            output in json format
      --no-error-on-diff, -e
                            don't exit with 2 if diff exists

For example:

    $ ./kubediff k8s
    Checking ReplicationController 'kubediff'
     *** .spec.template.spec.containers[0].args[0]: '-repo=https://github.com/weaveworks/kubediff' != '-repo=https://github.com/<your github repo>'
    Checking Secret 'kubediff-secret'
    Checking Service 'kubediff'

Make sure the dependencies are installed first:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Kubediff can also be run as a service on Kubernetes, periodically downloading the
latest configuration from Github, comparing it to the running configuration.  In
this mode Kubediff will also offers a very simple UI showing the output and
export the result to Prometheus, all courtesy to [prom-run](https://github.com/tomwilkie/prom-run).

To deploy to Kubernetes, you much first make a copy of the YAML files in `k8s`
and update the following fields:

- `kubediff-rc.yaml` the first argument to git-sync must be the location of
  the config repo, and the last argument to kubediff must the the location
  in this repo of your config.
- `kubediff-secret.yaml` the username and password must be set to valid
  [github OAuth token](https://developer.github.com/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#https-cloning-with-oauth-tokens).

Once you have updated the config, the following commands should bring up
the service:

    $ kubectl create -f k8s
    replicationcontroller "kubediff" created
    secret "kubediff-secret" created
    service "kubediff" created

And to view the UI, run the follow command and go to [http://localhost:4040](http://localhost:4040)

    `$ kubectl port-forward $(kubectl get pod --selector=name=kubediff -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}) 4040:80`

This service exports the exit code of the kubediff as a Prometheus metric;
a suitable alert can be setup for persistent differences:

    ALERT Kubediff
      IF          max(command_exit_code{job="kubediff"}) != 0
      FOR         2h
      LABELS      { severity="warning" }
      ANNOTATIONS {
        summary = "Kubediff has detected a difference in running config.",
        description = "Kubediff has detected a difference in running config.",
      }

These alerts can be sent to Slack, for example:

## compare-images

To quickly see how two sets of configurations differ, purely in terms of
images:

    $ ./compare-images ../service-conf/k8s/dev/ ../service-conf/k8s/prod/
    Image                          dev                   prod
